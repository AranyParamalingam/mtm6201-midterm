                    <h2>How we Started</h2>
                    <p>Sweet Treats Bakery was born out of the passion and love for baking of its founder, Sarah. Sarah's journey began in her home kitchen, where she would experiment with different recipes and techniques, creating delicious treats that were loved by her family and friends. As her passion for baking grew, she began to dream of starting her own bakery, where she could share her creations with a wider audience. After years of perfecting her recipes and techniques, Sarah decided to take the leap and start Sweet Treats Bakery. She rented a small space, bought the necessary equipment, and began baking her heart out. Soon, word spread about the delicious treats coming out of Sarah's bakery, and the demand for her products grew rapidly. Today, Sweet Treats Bakery is a thriving business with a loyal following, offering a wide range of delectable treats that are made with the same passion and love that inspired its inception.</p>
